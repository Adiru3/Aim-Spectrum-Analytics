# Aim Mastery: The Biomechanics & Engineering of Aiming

An interactive, high-performance web report deconstructing the neuro-motor control spectrum of competitive FPS games. This project analyzes the synergy between **CS2 (Source 2)**, **Apex Legends (Momentum)**, and **Overwatch 2 (Inertia-free)** systems to achieve 100% skill coverage.

## 🚀 Overview

This website serves as the final documentation for the **Aim Spectrum Research** conducted by **Adiru (amazingb01)**. It provides a technical breakdown of 11 pages of research, visual analytics, and actionable training recommendations.

### Key Features
- **100% Skill Coverage Analysis**: Detailed decomposition of Static, Reactive, Smooth, and Switching aim.
- **Interactive Game Profiles**: Biomechanical roles of CS2, Apex Legends, and Overwatch 2.
- **Data Visualizations**: Plotly-powered Intensity Matrix (Heatmap) and Chart.js Spectral analysis.
- **Trilingual Support**: Full professional translation into English (EN), Russian (RU), and Ukrainian (UA).
- **100% SEO Optimized**: Deep Microdata (Schema.org), OpenGraph, and JSON-LD integration.
- **Premium Design**: Cyberpunk-inspired glassmorphism with smooth CSS animations.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Structure**: Semantic HTML5
- **Style**: Custom Vanilla CSS (Glassmorphism design system)
- **Logic**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Charts**: Chart.js & Plotly.js
- **Fonts**: Inter & Playfair Display (Google Fonts)

## 📖 Research Summary

The core thesis of the research is that typical aim trainers isolate mechanics but fail to provide the "live context" of game engines. By rotating through the three specific disciplines analyzed in this project, a player can develop:
1. **Stopping Power** (CS2/Valorant)
2. **Smoothness/Momentum** (Apex Legends)
3. **Pure Reaction** (Overwatch 2)
